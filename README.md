# springboot-elasticsearch-docker
Spring Boot Elasticsearch Application using Docker Compose


This is still a Work In Progress project and hence all containers have to be run separately.

Use these commands to run 

1. Build the project using `./mvnw clean install`
2. Run the elasticsearch container using `docker compose elasticsearc -d`
3. Run the springboot app `docker compose apiserver`
